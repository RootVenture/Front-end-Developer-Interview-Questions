# JS Questions:

### Explain event delegation
`Event delegation` is a technique involving adding event listeners to a **parent element** instead of adding them to the descendant elements. The listener will fire whenever the event is triggered on the descendant elements due to `event bubbling` up the DOM. The benefits of this technique are:

* Memory footprint goes down because only one single handler is needed on the parent element, rather than having to attach event handlers to each descendent
* There is no need to unbind the handler from elements that are removed and to bind the event to new elements.

`Event bubbling` provides the foundation for event delegation in browsers. Now you can bind an event handler to a single parent element, and that handler will get executed whenever the even occurs on any of its child nodes (and any of their children in turn).

### Explain how `this` works in JavaScript
The call-site determines where `this` will point during the execution of a function.

1. **Default Binding** - Think of this this rule as the default catch-all rule when none of the other rules apply. If in strict mode ('use strict'), `this` will be undefined instead of the `global` object. In a browser, it will be the `window` object.
2. **Implicit Binding** - If the call-site have a context object, also referred to as an owning or containing object - `obj.method()`, `this` is the object that the function is a property of.
3. **Explicit Binding** - functions have `call(..)` and `apply(..)` methods which both take, as their first parameter, an object to use for the `this`, and then invoke the function with that this specified. 
4. **`new` Binding** - If the new keyword is used when calling the function, this inside the function is a brand new object.
When a function is invoked with `new` or otherwise known as a constructor call, the following things are done automatically:

	1. a brand new object is created (aka, constructed) out of thin air
	2. the newly constructed object is [[Prototype]]-linked
	3. the newly constructed object is set as the this binding for that function call
	4. unless the function returns its own alternate object, the new-invoked function call will automatically return the newly constructed object.

5. If the function is an ES2015 arrow function, it ignores all the rules above and receives the this value of its surrounding scope at the time it is created.

### Explain how prototypal inheritance works
When attempting a property access on an object that doesn't have that property, the object's internal `[[Prototype]]` linkage defines where the `[[Get]]` operation  should look next. This cascading linkage from object to object essentially defines a `"prototype chain"` of objects to traverse for property resolution. This simulates inheritance, but is correctly identified as **delegation** rather than inheritance.

### Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: `function foo(){ }();`. What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?
IIFE stands for immediately invoked function expression. An IIFE is an anonymous function that is created than immediately invoked. It's not called anywhere else and is run right after creation.  IIFEs are used to guard against **unintended effects of hoisting**. IIFEs can also be used to enforce **private variables and methods**.

Foo isn’t being called in the original question:

```
function foo(){
}();
```

This is a function **definition**, it defines foo. But it’s not a function **expression** - that is, it’s not understood by the JS parser to actually call a function.

For the parser to understand that it is dealing with a function **expression**, we would have to wrap things in an `()`: `(function foo(){}())` and `(function foo(){})()`.
